# WHILE LOOPS EXERCISES

# Set the total variable to 0 to start with. While the total is 50 or less, Ask the user to input a number in number_1
# variable. Add that number to the total and print the message “The total is… [total]”.
# Stop the loop when the total is over 50. Final result save in result_1 variable

# Ask the user to enter a number and save in number_2 variable. Keep asking until they enter a value over 5 and then
# display the message “The last number you entered was a [number]” and stop the program. The last result save in
# result_2 variable

# Ask for the name of somebody the user wants to invite to a party. Save name in variable name_2
# After this, display the message “[name] has now been invited” and add 1 to the count variable.
# Then ask if they want to invite somebody else. Get only "yes" or "no" answers
# Keep repeating this until they no longer want to invite anyone else to the party and then display how many people
# they have coming to the party.
